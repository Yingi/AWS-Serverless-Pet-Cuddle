# Step 3

In this stage we will be creating an State Machine(Step functions) which is the logic of the application, We will also create an IAM Role for the State Machine. We will be configuring the State Machine so it can use the required lambda function (The one we created in Step 2). So lets begin



## CREATE STATE MACHINE ROLE

We will again be creating an `IAM role` for our state machine using `Cloud Formation`

- Click https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=StateMachineRole&templateURL=https://kem-labs-stack.s3.amazonaws.com/statemachinerole.yaml

- Check the `I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources` box and then click `Create Stack`

- Wait for the Stack to move into the `CREATE_COMPLETE` state before moving into the next

Move to the IAM Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/roles and review the STATE MACHINE role note how it gives:
* logging permissions
* the ability to invoke the email lambda function when it needs to send emails
* the ability to use SNS to send text messages




## CREATE STATE MACHINE

- Go to the AWS `Step Functions` Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/states/home?region=us-east-1#/homepage

Click the `Hamburger Menu` at the `top left` and click `State Machines`

Click `Create State Machine`

Select `Write your workflow in code` which will allow you to use `Amazon States Language`

Scroll down for `type` select `standard`

Open this in a new tab https://learn-cantrill-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-serverless-pet-cuddle-o-tron/pet-cuddle-o-tron.json

This is the `Amazon States Language` (ASL) file for the pet-cuddle-o-tron state machine

Copy the contents into your clipboard

Move back to the step functions console

Select all of the code snippet and delete it

`Paste` in your clipboard

Click the `Refresh` icon on the right side area ... next to the visual map of the state machine.

Look through the visual overview and the ASL .. and make sure you understand the flow through the state machine.

The state machine `starts` ... and then waits for a certain time period based on the `Timer state`. 

This is controlled by the web front end you will deploy soon.

Then the `ChoiceState` is used, and this is a branching part of the state machine. 

Depending on the option picked in the UI, it either moves to :-
* `EmailOnly` : Which sends an email reminder
* `SMSOnly` : Which sends only an SMS reminder
* `EmailandSMS` : which is a parallel state which runs both `ParallelEmail` and `ParallelSMS` which does both.

The state machine will control the flow through the serverless application.. once stated it will coordinate other AWS services as required.




## CONFIGURE STATE MACHINE

In the state machine ASL (the code on the left) locate the `EmailOnly` definition.

Look for `EMAIL_LAMBDA_ARN` which is a placeholder, replace this with the `email_reminder_lambda` ARN you noted down in the previous step. This is the `ARN` of the lambda function you created. 

Next, locate the `ParallelEmail` definition.

Look for the `EMAIL_LAMBDA_ARN` which is a placeholder, replace this with the `email_reminder_lambda` ARN you noted down in the previous step. This is the `ARN` of the lambda function you created.

Scroll down to the bottom and click `next` For State machine name use `PetCuddleOTron`

Scroll down and under `Permissions` select `Choose an existing role` and select `StateMachineRole` from the dropdown (it should be the only one, if you have multiple select the correct one and there will be random which is fine as this was created by CloudFormation) 

Scroll down, under `Logging`, change the Log Level to `All`

Scroll down to the bottom and click `Create state machine`

Locate the `ARN` for the `state machine` on the top left... note this down somewhere safe as State Machine ARN




## DONE WITH STEP 3

We have configured the `state machine` which is the core part of the serverless application. The state machine controls the flow through the application and is responsible for interacting with other AWS products and services.
